# WorkoutAnywhere

WorkoutAnywhere is a mobile application that I developed with Alecsander Gonzalez as part of our Intro to Software Engineering course.

The WorkoutAnywhere app is designed for the Android platform, and it allows users to create a personalized workout based on their height, weight, gender, and available equipment. The app generates a workout of their choice with their desired intensity and guides them through it, including a rest timer and exercise descriptions upon request. Our goal in creating this app was to make it easier for beginners to get started with exercise and to provide intermediate gym-goers with a helpful tool when working out in an unfamiliar environment.

Part of this project included creating documentation for the code. Documentation is available to download as a pdf or can be viewed from this link here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OSGUZwC7hhjyT0eclPxOIZt-37dIGeTU/view?usp=sharing
